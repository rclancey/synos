go-sonos
========

  1.  Service descriptions should be used to validate SOAP method calls
  2.  Should have a version of upnp.Call that uses reflection to extract arguments from a struct
  3.  TestDicovery cannot be run alongside other tests, since it will try to make duplicate Handle() requests in net/http
  4.  sonos.MakeSonos should take an argument to indicate which services should be described
